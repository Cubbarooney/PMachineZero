Welcome to PMZero

This was a project that I completed back in 2015 for my Systems Software class. The goal was to creat a virtual machine that was able to compile and then run Pascal code files. It was relatively simple (not all statements were accepted). As of writing, this is mostly the tangled mess that was left on my machine. I am going to attempt to sort through the project and clean up the code.

I believe that the folder "New folder" was the final submission.
