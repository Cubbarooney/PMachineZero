Welcome to PMZeroAlpha!

	If you are reading this, then you are trying to use PMSZeroBeta! Huzzah! I like you!
But you must first learn how to use the machine!

	First and foremost, you will need to move the file "scanner.c" to the folder
you wish to use. You will also need to move the input file ("input.txt") into the same folder as
the .c file.

	Second, you need to compile the code! This is as simple as navigating to the containing
folder in your command line/prompt/whatchamacallit and running "gcc -o PMSZero scanner.c" in the
command line.

	When you decide to run the compiled code, type "./PMSZero" and just let the magic happen!
If an error is detected in the input code (such as an inputed number is too large), the
compilation will halt and an error message will be posted on the command line. It is also worth
noting that once a period is read, the compilation will halt, albeit not with an error warning.

	To view the output, just type "cat [filename.txt]" and see the magic that just happened!
Or, if you have a file browser (GO WINDOWS!), then just open the given file by double clicking
on it. Either way, you should see the results of the magic of PMSZeroBeta!

Cheers!
