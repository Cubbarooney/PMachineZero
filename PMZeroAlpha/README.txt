Welcome to PMZeroAlpha!

	If you are reading this, then you are trying to use PMZeroAlpha! Huzzah! I like you!
But you must first learn how to use the machine!

	First and foremost, you will need to move the file "PMachineZeroAlpha.c" to the folder
you wish to use. You will also need to move the input file ("mcode.txt") into the same folder as
the .c file.

	Second, you need to compile the code! This is as simple as navigating to the containing
folder in your command line/prompt/whatchamacallit and running
"gcc -o PMZero PMachineZeroALpha.c" in the command line.

	When you decide to run the compiled code, type "./PMZero" and just let the magic happen!

	To view the output, just type "cat stacktrace.txt" and see the magic that just happened!
Or, if you have a file browser (GO WINDOWS!), then just open "stacktrace.txt" by double clicking
on it. Either way, you should see the results of the magic of PMZeroAlpha!

Cheers!
